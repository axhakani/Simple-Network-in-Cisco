# Simple-Network-in-Cisco

In this project I have decided to create a network using Cisco Packet Tracer. This report will
have every detail of the process, from the infrastructure to the configuration code of the router.
We begin with choosing the right components of the network.
The network we want to create will have two cable networks and a wireless one. We have to
follow these footsteps:
- We choose the components provided from the Packet tracer: one router, two switches
and one access point. Connected in the network will be 4 host machines (PCs), two on
each network, and host machines (LPs) on the access point network. In table 1.0 we will
find a list of the devices used in the network and their description.
